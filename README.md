# CORS-Anywhere Server

[CORS-Anywhere](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors-anywhere) is a Node.js package that adds [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) headers to a proxied request. This is useful when the API provider does not natively support CORS. Without altering the headers, a request to such a provider would cause an error and prevent the request from being fulfilled.

**Tip:** You can test out the server in this repo locally by using ports `3000` or `5000` in your application and prepending one of the proxy URLs listed below to your API request [like this](https://github.com/isoaxe/ravenous/blob/master/src/util/searchYelp.js#L10). You can also test your API endpoints with `cors-server` in the remote environment [here](https://test-my-api-endpoint.web.app). If you want to host your own server, follow the steps in the Implementation section below.


## Proxy URLs

Below are the URLs that can be used for local testing on ports `3000` or `5000`.

**Firebase:** `https://proxy-ibmasyzzya-uc.a.run.app/`

**Fly.io:** `https://cors-server.fly.dev/`


## Implementation

The server can be implemented in one of four ways. Is is recommended to use Firebase or Fly.io.


### Firebase

Navigate to the [`functions`](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server/tree/master/functions) directory and follow the steps within the `README.md` therein. This is one of the recommended implementations.

### Fly.io

Navigate to the [`fly.io`](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server/tree/master/fly.io) directory and follow the steps within the `README.md` therein. This is one of the recommended implementations.

### Heroku

Navigate to the [`heroku`](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server/tree/master/heroku) directory and follow the steps within the `README.md` therein. Note that Heroku has [withdrawn](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours) provision of free dynos as of 28th of November 2022. The [cost](https://www.heroku.com/pricing) is now $5 for 1,000 dyno hours per month on the _Eco_ plan that can be used across multiple apps. If this is your only Heroku project, then a potentially much cheaper option is the _Basic_ plan that is only 1Â¢ per hour. This is billed on a _pro rata_ basis, so you only pay when the server is active. Even if on 24/7, this would only be $7 per month.

### Railway

Navigate to the [`railway`](https://github.com/isoaxe/cors-server/tree/master/railway) directory and follow the steps within the `README.md` therein. Unfortunately the free monthly allowance gets reached after 500 hours (about 21 days) under the free [_Trial_](https://railway.app/pricing) plan, so best to go with one of the other options.
